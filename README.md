## Custom
 
Custom is a mod that allows content creators to add their own blocks, items, enchantments, trades, and more via .json files. It also provides new data tags and a (wip) event system to add functionality to your content. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/creoii/Custom/wiki/Home) to learn how to use it!
